Process and Intention: I created this website/project as a personal tool for practicing music and music theory. Users can select parameters like key, mode, chord number, and ending to receive a randomly generated set of playable chords that match their input. The development process was challengingâ€”I needed to find a free, copyright-friendly sound library that contained just the musical notes. Implementing this into the code took three months to reach its current state. I've been developing it for two years now, mostly debugging, though I'm considering updating the website's visual design. The project serves as a practical practice tool, which I use myself. Through this experience, I learned that while bugs can be tricky, a determined developer can be even more resourceful. Looking ahead, I hope to channel this work into creating a game that incorporates my music theory knowledge.
